**Generic File Tool Integration, Legacy FileCompareTool Replacement, and Local Test Ignore Rules**
- **Generic File Compare Tool Integration**: Added the `Tools/files/` generic file comparison toolchain, consolidating compare/copy/delete workflows into maintainable Python modules. The tool is domain-agnostic rather than YOLO-label-specific, so it can support future OCR `.txt/.json` outputs, cropped images, and arbitrary folder synchronization.
- **CLI / GUI / Core Logic**: Added `Tools/files/file_compare_core.py`, `file_compare_cli.py`, and `file_compare_app.py` for the shared compare/copy/delete engine, command-line entry point, and Tkinter GUI. Destructive actions are previewed by default through dry-run behavior to reduce the risk of accidental dataset deletion or overwrite.
- **Optional C++ Hash Acceleration and Packaging Flow**: Added `Tools/files/cpp/file_hash_accelerator.cpp`, `CMakeLists.txt`, and `build_file_compare_exe.bat` for optional content-hash acceleration and PyInstaller packaging. A follow-up update added `file_compare_tool.spec` and build-related artifacts.
- **Invalid Polygon Image Extraction Tool**: Added `Tools/extract_invalid_polygon_images.py`, which parses `檔案: xxx.txt` entries from Markdown issue lists, recursively locates corresponding images, and copies them to an output folder for investigating self-intersecting polygon annotation issues.
- **Legacy Tool Replacement**: Removed the old root-level `FileCompareTool/` Qt/executable bundle to avoid maintaining duplicate implementations now that `Tools/files/` provides the replacement workflow.
- **Local Test File Ignore Rules**: Updated `.gitignore` to ignore local OCR test files and prevent temporary test data from being committed.

## 2026-05-06
**Multi-version Model Evaluation and Documentation Maintenance**
- **Model Version Review**: Organized and compared 5 model variants (V4, V5-960-R1, V5-960-R2, V5-1280, V5-1280-Seg).
- **Segmentation Results**: Confirmed that **YOLO V5 (1280) Seg** currently delivers the best localization quality, achieving **90.02% mAP50-95**.
- **Documentation Maintenance**: Updated `TaiwanLicensePlate/README.md` with the latest performance comparison table and model-selection conclusions.
- **Sampling Data-Engineering Workbench Update**: Kept `Tools/sampling/gui.py` aligned with the multi-tab workbench for image deduplication, negative sampling, validation cleaning, YOLO testing, and Auto Label. The Qt logging bridge was refactored by separating `GUILogHandler` from `LogEmitter` to avoid shutdown errors caused by handlers retaining destroyed QObject instances.
- **Service Layer and Constants**: Added/maintained `Tools/sampling/services.py` and `Tools/sampling/constants.py` for shared GUI/CLI workflows, supported extension lists, and file collection helpers.
- **Auto Label Workflow Restored**: Updated `Tools/sampling/auto_label.py` with `DetectionBox`, `AutoLabelCandidate`, `AutoLabelSelector`, `AutoLabelWorkflow`, and image / YOLO txt / AnyLabel JSON writers so the GUI Auto Label tab and `AutoLabelService` match the actual implementation.
- **Import Compatibility**: Adjusted internal sampling imports so both `python -m Tools.sampling.gui` and `python Tools/sampling/gui.py` execution modes remain compatible.
- **Documentation Synchronization**: Rebuilt `Tools/sampling/detail/SAMPLING_DETAILS_zh.md` and synchronized `SAMPLING_DETAILS_en.md`, README, and development logs. The outdated K-Means / Top-K Auto Label description has been replaced with the current YOLO high-confidence candidate + embedding-similarity deduplication + multi-format export workflow.
- **Polygon Annotation Issue**: Confirmed polygon-labeling problems and tracked them under Issue #2 discussion notes.

**Open-source Project Internationalization and CI/CD Setup**
- **Template Internationalization**: Converted issue templates, PR templates, contribution guide, and code of conduct resources into English to improve the project’s international open-source readiness.
- **Automation Checks Added**:
  - Added `pr-lint.yml` to validate semantic pull-request titles via GitHub Actions.
  - Added `python-ci.yml` for lightweight Python syntax/style checks using flake8, configured as non-blocking with `--exit-zero`.
  - Added `dependabot.yml` to automate dependency update monitoring for GitHub Actions and pip packages.

**Multi-resolution Model Training and Labeling Issue Resolution**
- **Multi-resolution Model Training**: Conducted training tests with different resolutions using different hardware:
  - Trained `test1` at `1280` resolution using an RTX 4090.
  - Trained `test2` at `960` resolution using an RTX 5070.
- **Poly Image Annotation Issue**: Discovered labeling errors during the training phase. Pre-training checks via `check_label.py` confirmed that a total of 79 Poly images in the dataset had invalid annotations (64 in train, 15 in val; specifically self-intersecting polygon segments). **An Issue has been posted to track and resolve this problem**.

## 2026-05-01 to 2026-05-03
**Automated Deduplication Filtering Mechanism (Sampling)**
- **High-Dimensional Feature Extraction & Deduplication**: Developed the `sampling` module, integrating MobileNetV3 to convert images into high-dimensional feature vectors (Embeddings). To achieve high-speed computation, PyTorch is utilized for GPU-accelerated tensor matrix operations, calculating a Cosine Similarity matrix to accurately filter out redundant frames. For detailed technical implementations and algorithm workflows, please refer to: [Sampling Module Implementation Details](./Tools/sampling/detail/SAMPLING_DETAILS_en.md).
- **Multi-layered Filtering Strategy**: Discarded the planned K-Means clustering in favor of **Bounding Box Count Comparison** and **YOLO Confidence Sorting**. The system only flags images as duplicates when both box counts are identical and feature similarity meets the threshold, ensuring rigorous and high-quality data cleaning.
- **Data Cleaning & Dataset Organization**: The design of the data cleaning and deduplication algorithm continued through May 3. The comprehensive organization of the dataset was fully completed on May 3.
- **Future Work**:
  - Explore the implementation of "Negative Sample Mining based on Contrastive Learning" to improve the performance of advanced retrieval models (Reference: Research by Tsai-Tsung, Chen).
